# Contributing

I love pull requests. If you have something great to share, lets see it.

Fork, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/dotfiles.git

Make your change. Then, push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/jamestomasino/dotfiles/compare/

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three business days (and, typically, one business day). We may suggest
some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Keep your addition organized
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
